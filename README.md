## Game Description
*The story of the game is an original idea, but the battle style in this game is referenced from the Pok√©mon series.*

The game is a role-playing game which is set in a fictional place called Yyetnal during the middle age.

After reading an old book the player found at home, the player goes on a journey to the legendary sword. While on his journey, he meets different monsters, bandits and gatekeepers to the treasure. In order to advance, the player needs to battle them and win. If he wins the battle, he gains hints to the place where the sword is hidden and also gains gold which could be used to upgrade his weapons and armour, and buy miscellaneous such as health potions when the player is in a town. Once the player reaches the place where the legendary sword is hidden, he has to defeat the final guardian who is protecting the sword to get the legendary sword. The game ends once the player defeats the guardian and gets the legendary sword.

## List of Features/Functions
1. Generation of random game sets or events

In battles, the player will deal a fixed amount of damage to his/her enemy based on the weapon the player is using. However, sometimes the player may miss the attack, or instead do a critical dmaage to the enemy. This will be decided randomly and the libraries <stdlib.h> will be included to use the rand() and srand() funtions to randomly generate such situations.

2. Data structures for storing game status

3. Dynamic memory management

4. File input/output

5. Program codes in multiple files
