After reading an old book he found at home, the player goes on a journey to the legendary sword. While on his journey, he meets different monsters, bandits and gatekeepers to the treasure. In order to advance, the player needs to battle them and win. If he wins the battle, he gains hints to the place where the sword is hidden and also gains gold which could be used to upgrade his weapons and armour, and buy miscellaneous such as health potions when the player is in a town. Once the player reaches the place where the legendary sword is hidden, he has to defeat the final guardian who is protecting the sword to get the legendary sword.
